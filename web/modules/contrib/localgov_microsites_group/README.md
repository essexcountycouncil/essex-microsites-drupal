# LocalGov Drupal Microsites: Group

Provides a microsites group type that provides customisations for theme, which
work out of the box with `localgov_microsites_base` theme.

Adds integration with `domain_group` for a group on a seperate domain.

Includes `localgov_microsites_permissions` that extends `group_permissions` to
allow microsite group administrators to set their individual permissions.
